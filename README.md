# Flex Project Proposal: 
## \< RecruiterRouter /\>, putting the closing tag on your Job Search (JS).

Please see this project's [wiki](https://github.com/dbodow/recruiter-router/wiki) for the full proposal!

# Project Overview:

RecruiterRouter is a portfolio website template builder for users who wish to customize their portfolios to better target recruiters in their job search. Just as a candidate might customize his or her cover letter to respond to a job listing, users can customize their personal portfolios with RecruiterRouter to highlight various features of their skillset and background depending on the job to which they are applying.

Recruiter Router has 3 key features:

### Portfolio Builder

* Allows users to manage content for their portfolios and to create and delete tags to focus their content to different audiences.

### Link Management / Custom Portfolio Viewing

* Allows users to associate different portfolios with companies they are applying to, generate custom urls to embed in resumes and job application materials, and manage these associations and links.

### Analytics

* Tracks visits to custom links and allows users to view companies' engagement with their various portfolio campaigns.

# Technology Stack

RecruiterRouter is built on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). Given the document-like structure of a static web portfolio page, we took advantage of MongoDB's document database structure and patterns of denormalized state to fetch and write data easily.
